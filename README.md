# NoSQL_DataEnrichment
This repository contains the submission for my Data Engineering course, focused on working with NoSQL databases, JSON enrichment, and data cleaning techniques. The assignment leverages MongoDB for data storage and querying, while Python (with `pandas` and `json`) is used for extracting, transforming, and enriching the dataset.
